      "prompt": " What's up game?",
      "response": " The \"What's Up?\" game, also known as \"Never Have I Ever,\" is a popular icebreaker and party game designed to encourage participants to share personal information about themselves. It can be played with at least four people or more, depending on the number of rounds and players' comfort level.\n\nTo play, each person takes turns asking questions starting with \"Have you ever...\" followed by something unusual, embarrassing, or unique that they haven't done. If a player has experienced what was asked, they must take a sip of their drink (usually alcoholic) or perform a penalty chosen beforehand.\n\nThe game aims to create an atmosphere of openness and honesty among participants, allowing them to learn more about each other through shared experiences."

      "prompt": " What is to wink, dad?",
      "response": " If you are asking \"What's up game?\" or more specifically, if it is a specific term for the \"Never Have I Ever\" icebreaker party game, then the question is not in sense. The term \"to wink\" is not a commonly used term and doesn't make sense in any context.\n\nIf you are asking about a game that has been played with more than four players or where the focus should be on the group rather than on the individual, then it is likely referring to a multi-player icebreaker party game like \"Never Have I Ever\" or \"Toeic.\" The term \"to wink\" doesn't make sense in any context."
